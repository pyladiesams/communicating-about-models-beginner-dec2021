# An Introduction to Communicating about your Models
### Level: Beginner

## Meetup description
The outcomes of our data analysis and machine learning work are usually applied in broader contexts. As a consequence, stakeholders who are no insiders to our technical approaches will need to have some understanding of how our models work. In this talk, I will highlight some common challenges and pitfalls encountered, making use of real-world examples. Based on these, we will interactively discuss how we can communicate better.
